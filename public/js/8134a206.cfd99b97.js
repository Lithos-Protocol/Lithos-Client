Compared to other decentralized mining pool protocols, such as SmartPool and P2Pool, Lithos is more scalable and more secure. Lithos takes advantage of multiple technologies and breakthroughs in PoW cryptocurrencies in order to provide an enhanced experience. Specifically, Lithos uses Non-Interactive Share Proofs (NISPs) in order to efficiently prove that a miner performed work on the blockchain. Additionally, Lithos takes advantage of collateralized mining pools to place block production back into the hands of miners.","permalink":"/assets/docs/tutorial-basics/lithos-info"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
