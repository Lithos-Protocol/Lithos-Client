Lithos allows Ergo miners to pool together their hashrates and receive rewards according to the work each miner performed. Unlike traditional mining pools, Lithos is completely decentralized, meaning that there is no single operator that manages the pool. Lithos pools work via smart contracts, which ensure fairness, transparency, and give control back to the miners.","permalink":"/assets/docs/intro"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
